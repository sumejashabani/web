<p>What is a paragraph? <b>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.</b> Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.
